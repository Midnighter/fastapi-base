A base [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for microservices using
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). The Docker image environment is based
on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and provides a Python environment with
FastAPI, [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [uvicorn
workers](https://www.uvicorn.org/) acting as an [Asynchronous Server Gateway
Interface (ASGI)](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Design

What is special about this Docker image? There are two key elements:

1. The image is completely deterministic in the sense that all Python
   dependencies are pinned exactly using the `pip-compile` command from the
   [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) including package hashes so
   that you can recreate the image exactly.
2. Every week, a [cron job](.github/workflows/cron-upgrade.yml) re-compiles the
   dependencies and if they changed, commits them.
3. When the dependencies change, the image is
   [re-built](.github/workflows/docker-image-ci.yml) and tagged with the
   information shown below, with the date of creation, and the short version of
   the commit hash, for example, `midnighter/fastapi-base:3.8-slim-buster_2020-07-03_d517373` That means, if
   you use these tags, you know _exactly_ what you are getting.

## Usage

You can combine this deterministic base image with your own in the following
ways. A tool like tag-spy can be used to retrieve the latest tag for each image
when you build your own.

```
docker run --rm dddecaf/tag-spy:latest tag-spy midnighter/fastapi-base 3.8-slim-buster

3.8-slim-buster_2020-07-03_d517373
```

All actual implementations of such microservices should be based on this image
and include the fastapi-requirements in their own requirements. In practice,
their `Dockerfile` needs to specify:

```dockerfile
ARG TAG=3.8-slim-buster_2020-07-03_d517373

FROM midnighter/fastapi-base:${TAG}
```

and their `requirements.in` file:

```
-r /opt/requirements/fastapi-requirements.txt
```

such that pinned (deterministic) versions are guaranteed.

## Python Environments

Images are generated for the following environments. Please [open an
issue](https://github.com/Midnighter/fastapi-base/issues/new) if you require
others.
