A base Docker image for microservices using FastAPI. The Docker image
environment is based on either Alpine Linux or Debian and provides a Python
environment with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/),
[gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [uvicorn
workers](https://www.uvicorn.org/) acting as an [Asynchronous Server Gateway
Interface (ASGI)](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage

All actual implementations of such microservices should be based on this image
and include the fastapi-requirements in their own requirements. In practice,
their `Dockerfile` needs to specify:

```dockerfile
FROM midnighter/fastapi-base:${TAG}
```

and their `requirements.in` file:

```
-r /opt/requirements/fastapi-requirements.txt
```

such that pinned (deterministic) versions are guaranteed.

## Python Environments
